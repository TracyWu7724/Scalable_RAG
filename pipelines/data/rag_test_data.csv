1,What is Permatex Surface Insensitive Threadlocker Blue?,"Permatex Medium Strength Threadlocker Blue Gel Twist Applicator puts the threadlocker where you want it. The gel formula provides 'liquid-reliability' without drips, globs, mess or waste. This all-purpose, medium strength threadlocker is ideal for all nut and bolt applications 1/4 inch to 1 inch (6mm to 25mm) and eliminates the need for stocking expensive lock nuts and lock washers. This will lock and seal while preventing parts from loosening due to vibration, as well as protect threads from corrosion. Removable with hand tools for easy disassembly. Applied as a liquid or gel, threadlockers are superior to conventional lock washers, nylon inserts, and other mechanical devices because they secure the entire fastener assembly against loosening from shock and vibration by filling the space between threaded metal parts, curing to form a tough, adhesive bond and seal. They also seal the threads against leakage, preventing rust and corrosion.",2,0,Similiar adhesive products from competitor

6,Loctite 567 suits for what scenairo?,"LOCTITE® 567™ is designed for the locking and sealing of metal
tapered threads and fittings. The product cures when confined in the
absence of air between close fitting metal surfaces and prevents
loosening and leakage from shock and vibration. LOCTITE® 567™
provides robust curing performance. The high lubricating properties
of this compound prevent galling on stainless steel, aluminum and
all other metal pipe threads and fittings. It not only works on active
metals (e.g. brass, copper) but also on passive substrates such as
stainless steel and plated surfaces. The product offers high
temperature performance and oil tolerance. It tolerates minor
surface contaminations from various oils, such as cutting,
lubrication, anti-corrosion and protection fluids. LOCTITE® 567™ is
recommended for industrial applications in the chemical processing,
petroleum refining, pulp/paper, waste treatment, textile,
utilities/power generation, marine, automotive, industrial equipment,
gas compression and distribution industries. It is also recommended
for industrial plant fluid power systems.",5,1,
