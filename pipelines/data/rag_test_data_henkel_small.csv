2,"If I want adhasives weaker than LOCTITE 271 , what is the product recommendation?","LOCTITE 243 is a medium strength threadlocking adhesive that seals and secures metal nuts and bolts to prevent loosening due to shock and vibration. It is designed for the locking and sealing of threadedfasteners which require normal disassembly with standard handtools. The product cures when confined in the absence of airbetween close fitting metal surfaces. LOCTITE 243 works on all metals, including passive substrates such as stainless steel, aluminium and plated surfaces. It is proven to be tolerant of minor contamination due to industrial oils.",5,1,
4,Loctite 401 suits for what scenairo?,"LOCTITE 401 is a fast-fixturing instant adhesive designed for the assembly of difficult-to-bond materials which require uniform stress distribution and strong tension and/or shear strength. The product provides rapid bonding of a wide range of materials, including metals, plastics and elastomers. It is also suited for
 bonding porous materials such as wood, paper, leather and fabric.",5,1,

6,Loctite 567 suits for what scenairo?,"LOCTITE® 567™ is designed for the locking and sealing of metal
tapered threads and fittings. The product cures when confined in the
absence of air between close fitting metal surfaces and prevents
loosening and leakage from shock and vibration. LOCTITE® 567™
provides robust curing performance. The high lubricating properties
of this compound prevent galling on stainless steel, aluminum and
all other metal pipe threads and fittings. It not only works on active
metals (e.g. brass, copper) but also on passive substrates such as
stainless steel and plated surfaces. The product offers high
temperature performance and oil tolerance. It tolerates minor
surface contaminations from various oils, such as cutting,
lubrication, anti-corrosion and protection fluids. LOCTITE® 567™ is
recommended for industrial applications in the chemical processing,
petroleum refining, pulp/paper, waste treatment, textile,
utilities/power generation, marine, automotive, industrial equipment,
gas compression and distribution industries. It is also recommended
for industrial plant fluid power systems.",5,1,
